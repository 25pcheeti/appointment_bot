# Reflection on Cookiecutter Data Science Structure

Before adopting Cookiecutter‑Data‑Science (CCDS), my project had one flat 
folder mixing Jupyter notebooks, raw scripts, and data files. It quickly 
became hard to find whether a file was exploratory, production code, or 
saved model artifacts. The CCDS template enforces a clear separation: 
`data/` for each pipeline stage, `src/` for runnable scripts, and a proper 
Python package under `appointment_bot/`. 

**Most helpful** is the strict data folder hierarchy: raw, interim, 
processed. It nails down “where does this CSV live?” and prevents 
accidental overwrites. Encapsulating library code in a module (with 
`__init__.py`) makes imports clean and unit‑testing straightforward. The 
`docs/` folder also encourages documenting structure, which I might have 
postponed otherwise.

**Least helpful** for me was the empty `external/` and `interim/` 
subfolders; in a small project, they feel over‑engineered. I may collapse 
them in future sprints but keep them for growth.

Overall, CCDS greatly improves **reproducibility**: any new collaborator 
immediately knows how to bootstrap an environment, run data pulls, and 
execute the pipeline via the Makefile or scripts. By prescribing where 
tests go, it also fosters **collaboration** through consistent naming and 
location conventions. In larger teams, this reduces onboarding friction 
and merge conflicts—everyone “speaks the same structure language.”
