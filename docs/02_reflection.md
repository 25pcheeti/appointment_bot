# Reflection on Cookiecutter Data Science Structure

Switching to the Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS) scaffold was eye‑opening 
compared to my original “flat” repository. Previously, I had scripts, 
data, and notebooks all mixed in one folder; now each concern lives in its 
own place (e.g., `src/`, `data/`, `reports/`, `docs/`).  

**Most helpful** is the clear separation of raw/interim/processed data and 
the standardized pipeline scripts in `src/`. I immediately saw how the 
download→clean→train flow maps to directories. **Least helpful** was the 
extra top‑level files I rarely touch (e.g., `environment.yml` vs. my own 
`requirements.txt`), but I recognize them as templates for different 
deployment contexts.

By isolating dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, environment specs in 
`environment.yml`, and reproducible scripts in `Makefile`, CCDS makes it 
trivial for someone else to reproduce my results on a fresh machine. In 
collaborative settings, contributors know exactly where to add new 
features (e.g., put new EDA notebooks in `notebooks/`, new plots in 
`reports/figures/`).  

If I could tweak CCDS, I’d merge `docs/` and `reports/` under a unified 
`documentation/` folder to reduce fragmentation. Overall, the CCDS layout 
enforces reproducible code by design—every step of the pipeline is 
scripted, version‑controlled, and clearly documented, minimizing “it works 
on my machine” surprises.
