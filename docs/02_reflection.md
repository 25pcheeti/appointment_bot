# Reflection on Cookiecutter Data Science Structure

Switching to the Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS) format was much better 
than my original messy repository. Previously, I had scripts, 
data, and notebooks all mixed in one folder; now each aspect is in its 
own place (e.g., `src/`, `data/`, `reports/`, `docs/`).  

**Most helpful** is the clear separation of raw/interim/processed data and 
the standardized pipeline scripts in `src/`. I immediately saw how the 
download→clean→train flow maps to directories. **Least helpful** was the 
extra top‑level files I rarely touch (e.g., `environment.yml` vs. my own 
`requirements.txt`), but I recognize them as templates for different 
deployment contexts.

By isolating dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, environment specs in 
`environment.yml`, and reproducible scripts in `Makefile`, CCDS makes it 
much easier for someone else to reproduce my results on a their own 
computer. In collaborative settings, contributors know exactly where to add new 
features (e.g., put new EDA notebooks in `notebooks/`, new plots in 
`reports/figures/`).  

If I could tweak CCDS, I’d merge `docs/` and `reports/` under a unified 
`documentation/` folder to reduce fragmentation. All in all, the CCDS 
layout enforces reproducible code by design as every step of the pipeline 
is scripted, version‑controlled, and clearly documented, minimizing 
clutter and maximizing readability.
